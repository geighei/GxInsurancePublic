@article{Chiappori2000,
abstract = {The first goal of this paper is to provide a simple and general test of the presence of asymmetric information in contractual relation- ships within a competitive context. We also argue that insurance data are particularly well suited to such empirical investigations. To illustrate this claim, we use data on contracts and accidents to investigate the extent of asymmetric information in the French market for automobile insurance. Using various parametric and nonparametric methods, we find no evidence for the presence of asymmetric information in this market. I.},

@article{Einav2011,
abstract = {Government intervention in insurance markets is ubiquitous and the theoretical basis for such intervention, based on classic work from the 1970s, has been the problem of adverse selection. Over the last decade, empirical work on selection in insurance markets has gained considerable momentum. This research finds that adverse selection exists in some insurance markets but not in others. And it has uncovered examples of markets that exhibit "advantageous selection"—a phenomenon not considered by the original theory, and one that has different consequences for equilibrium insurance allocation and optimal public policy than the classical case of adverse selection. Advantageous selection arises when the individuals who are willing to pay the most for insurance are those who are the most risk averse (and so have the lowest expected cost). Indeed, it is natural to think that in many instances individuals who value insurance more may also take action to lower their expected costs: drive more carefully, invest in preventive health care, and so on. Researchers have taken steps toward estimating the welfare consequences of detected selection and of potential public policy interventions. In this essay, we present a graphical framework for analyzing both theoretical and empirical work on selection in insurance markets. This graphical approach provides both a useful and intuitive depiction of the basic theory of selection and its implications for welfare and public policy, as well as a lens through which one can understand the ideas and limitations of existing empirical work on this topic.},

@article{Smith1999,
abstract = {The first section of this paper documents the size of the association between health and one prominent economic status measure--household wealth. The next section deals with how health influences economic status by sketching out reasons why health may alter household savings (and eventually wealth) and then providing estimates of the empirical magnitude of these effects. The third section shifts attention to the other pathway--the links between economic status and health--and summarizes major controversies and evidence surrounding these issues.},
annote = {Reverse causality between health and wealth:
- environmental conditions during childhood influenced by SES of parents determines later health outcomes
- poor health later in life leads to lower income and higher expenditures

- The striking result is how modest out-of-pocket medical costs are for the average person and how relatively insensitive costs are to the onset of even serious illnesses. 

- More concretely, the RAND health insurance study, which used an experimental design to investigate how people reacted to different patterns of co-payments and deductibles, found that lower payments for health care do increase utilization of health care services, but result in only minor effects on most health outcomes (Newhouse, 1993).},
