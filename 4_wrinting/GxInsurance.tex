\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Moral Hazard
Moral hazard shapes behaviors in all domains characterized by asymmetric information \citep{Arrow1963,Finkelstein2014}.
Propensity to moral hazard can differ across individuals, the same as preferences and beliefs.
Unlike preferences and beliefs, heterogeneity in moral hazard has been proposed but never directly measured \citep{Einav2013,Dubois2009,Kowalski2018moral}.
Leveraging information on genetic variants associated with smoking behavior, we provide a novel approach to measuring heterogeneity in moral hazard.

%Contribution
To measure heterogeneity in moral hazard, we estimate how individuals carrying different genetic variants differentially change their smoking behavior following a cardio-vascular health shock when they are not covered by health insurance.
Combining the genetic and moral hazard factors shaping health behaviors, we contribute to the burgeoning literature studying gene-environment interactions \citep{Caspi2002,Fletcher2012,Barcellos2018,Belsky2018mobility,Schmitz2017,Schmitz2017vietnam,Wedow2018,Papageorge2020}. %Murcray2009,Young2016
Specifically, this study is the first to show how genetic risk and insurance coverage jointly influence individual choices of health behavior.
We show that moral hazard stemming from health insurance (financial risk) interacts with the genetic predisposition for smoking (Sgenetic risk) in determining the probability of smoking cessation following a health shock.
Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal population-based study of elderly Americans, we estimated how experiencing a health shock between survey waves affected the smoking probability of individuals with different coverage levels and genetic predispositions for smoking.

%Identification
To cleanly identify this interplay between genes and the environment, we leverage a key feature of the US health insurance system: Medicare, which provides public health insurance to all US citizens older than 65.
Before the introduction of the Affordable Care Act \citep{Obama2016}, a significant fraction of the population younger than 65 was still uninsured \citep{Cohen2009,Barnett2016}.
Exploiting the differential timing of health shocks before or after the Medicare-eligibility age of 65 for previously uninsured individuals, we estimate that Medicare eligibility reduced smoking cessation rates after a health shock by 25.6 percentage points, but only for those individuals with a low index of genetic propensity to smoking.
Comparing this effect between individuals with a high versus a low index of genetic predisposition for smoking allows for an assessment of how the moral hazard problem found in previous research interacts with genetic risk.

%Cost of smoking
We focus on smoking behavior because chronic diseases and health care costs caused by tobacco use are estimated to be one of the biggest health challenges in industrialized countries, and have rapidly increased in importance in the developing world \citep{USDHHS2014,Goodchild2018}.
In the US, smoking is estimated to cause more than 400,000 premature deaths annually \citep{Ma2018}, and the economic costs of smoking-related illness amount to around \$300 billion each year, including almost \$170 billion for direct medical care and an additional \$156 billion in lost productivity \citep{USDHHS2014, Xu2015}.
Both the health burden from smoking-related illness as well as the economic burden on an already strained health care system have made it a priority to understand what factors affect individuals' smoking decisions, and how health care can effectively encourage cessation.

%Smoking cessation and moral hazard
Smoking cessation, like many other health behaviors, is influenced both by environmental and genetic factors.
One environmental factor that has been associated with a reduction in tobacco consumption is health insurance coverage \citep{Dave2009,Richards2014,Marti2017}, especially after experiencing a severe smoking-related health shock, like the onset of a cardiovascular illness \citep{Clark2002,Falba2005,Khwaja2006learn,Keenan2009,Sundmacher2012}.
%The extent to which smoking behavior is improved after a health shock depends, among other things, on the financial cost the individual is faced with after the shock \citep{Richards2014,Marti2017}
Alleviating the financial burden of health care costs, health insurance can have the unintended side effect of preventing beneficial behavior changes that would have taken place if the individuals were fully responsible for the financial consequences of poor health \citep{Marti2017}.
This adverse incentive created by health insurance is a typical example of ``moral hazard'': the notion that individuals change their behavior in an undesired way because the consequences of their actions are not (fully) borne by themselves \citep{Einav2018,Zweifel2000}.

%Genetics
Another factor that is tightly linked to smoking behavior is genetic makeup.
Genetic factors can explain around 30\% to 85\% of the variance in regular smoking, according to several studies comparing identical and fraternal twins \citep{Heath1993, Sullivan1999, Hall2002, Li2003, Boardman2010}.
In recent years, significant progress has been made in identifying genetic variants associated with susceptibility to smoking \citep{Liu2010,Thorgeirsson2008,Thorgeirsson2010,TAG2010,GSCAN2019gwas}.
In particular, most genetic variants from the \textit{CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4} gene cluster, which influences nicotine response and metabolism and which studies link to nicotine dependence, are strongly associated with smoking phenotypes \citep{stoker2013unraveling}.
Genetic variants near dopamine receptors are strongly associated with daily smoking and difficulty in cessation, but not with smoking initiation-related phenotypes, suggesting that dopamine-related variants become more relevant as an individual's nicotine use progresses \citep{GSCAN2019gwas}.
Indices of genetic predisposition to smoke have been shown to be related to smoking initiation, and individuals of higher genetic risk are more likely to develop dependence faster and more frequently and to fail in their cessation attempts \citep{belsky2013polygenic}.
Thus, genetic data may capture an individual's predisposition for smoking behaviors via multiple biological channels including addiction in addition to nicotine response.

%GxE
These developments in mapping the genetic architecture of health behaviors, together with an increased availability of genetic measures in large representative surveys, allow for a better understanding of how genetics can interact with other environmental factors in determining smoking behavior and nicotine dependence.
For example, adolescent environmental shocks have been shown to alter the influence of specific genetic variants on an individual's risk of developing nicotine dependence \citep{bierut2014glimpse,chen2009interplay,johnson2010peer}.
%was thinking about adding Domingue et al (2016) here, a study that finds that genetic influence in smoking has increased over time as information and education about smoking has become widely available. I thought to suggest this suggests a differential response to this proliferation of information on the basis of genetic risk, but I think that may be extrapolating too much so I've left it out, just noting in case we want to work this in.
More generally, the relationship between genetic variants and smoking has been shown to depend on neighborhood characteristics \citep{meyers2013interaction} the cohort of birth \citep{domingue2016cohort,Wedow2018}, military service in the Vietnam era \citep{schmitz2016long}, and tobacco taxes \citep{Fletcher2012,Slob2020}.

% big picture
Our results highlight the importance of considering genetic predisposition when evaluating behavioral responses to shocks and policies, such as health insurance coverage \citep{Brock1993,Morrison2005}.
Genetic predispositions can curb the negative behavioral consequences and the moral hazard associated with changes in health insurance status.
Besides being relevant for the debate about equal and fair access to health insurance, our results highlight a new avenue of potential future research:
leveraging recent advances in molecular and human genetics, we identify a new form of individual heterogeneity in the response to treatments. This heterogeneity used to be unobserved, which could lead to incorrect policy conclusions.
In the era of genomics and personalized medicine, an individual genetic makeup can be a factor not only in the treatment they receive, but also in their response to insurance coverage \citep{Khera2018,Torkamani2018,Schork2018,Ritz2017}.
A new form of individual heterogeneity in treatment effects \citep{Papageorge2020}.
Since individuals are endowed at conception with their genetic makeup, and they have not done anything to deserve it or be held accountable for it \citep{Barth2019,Kweon2020,Pereira2021,Harden2021}, this differential response to insurance shocks raises questions of fairness and equality in the public debate over health insurance policies.

More generally, we show how leveraging recent developments in behavioral and molecular genetics can shed new light on fundamental economic concepts, such as elasticity of response to health shocks and heterogeneity in moral hazard.
These concepts are formalized more precisely in the model in Appendix \ref{appsec:model}.
Indices of genetic predisposition to health behaviors provide readily available individual measures of heterogeneity that can enrich our economic models.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Data %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

\subsection{Study Sample}\label{sec:sample}

The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal household survey initiated in 1992 among US citizens aged 50 and older, followed for 12 biannual waves over 22 years, containing detailed medical, economic, social, psychological, and genetic information about the respondents \citep{Sonnega2014cohort}.%
\footnote{Response rates vary between 80\% and 90\% \citep{HRSResponseRate}. Every 6 years, a new 6-year birth cohort of participants is enrolled \citep{HRS21stCentury}. It is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (grant number NIA U01AG009740) and is conducted by the University of Michigan \citep{HRSWebsite}.
The first core interview with every participant is conducted face-to-face, and all follow-up interviews are either face-to-face or over the phone \citep{HRS21stCentury}.
}
%This study uses data from the publicly available RAND HRS file (version P)\citep{HRSRAND}---an easy-to-use longitudinal data set based on the HRS data---as well as the publicly available initial release of the HRS polygenic scores data \citep{HRSPGENSCORE}.

Genetic information comes from DNA samples collected in face-to-face interviews, for which a random subset of HRS households were selected to participate in 2006, 2008, and 2010.
Saliva samples are collected and genotyped for more than 15,000 participants \citep{HRSPGenscore2017}.
More information on the DNA extraction and the genotyping process is provided in Section \ref{supsec:dna_genotyping} in the Appendix.

The analysis is done on a subsample of the data selected based on criteria of age (between 60-70 at the time of interview), ever-smokers at baseline (their first observation), observed in at least 2 different time periods, and genetically of European descent.
5,854 HRS respondents satisfy these criteria and have non-missing values for the main variables of interest (smoking status, polygenic score (PGS) for regular smoking, insurance status, and the occurrence of heart conditions or strokes).\footnote{See Section \ref{supsec:study_sample} in the Appendix for more information on the construction of the study sample.}
The age restriction imposed on the study sample increases comparability between those experiencing a health shock before or after age 65.
The restriction imposed on genetic ancestry is best-practice in social-science genetics to avoid issues of population stratification, for example, mistaking a genetic variant with different allele frequencies in Asians and Caucasians for a marker of ability to use chopsticks \citep{Hamer2000}. The restriction also increases the sample's similarity with the genetic profile of the discovery sample used in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) that informed the weights for the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) used for calculating the PGS \citep{Martin2017,Freese2018}.\footnote{\cite{Martin2017} convincingly show that past attempts to use polygenic scores to compare racial or ethnic-group achievements were scientifically flawed. Sadly, this reduces the external validity of any study that uses polygenic scores informed by GWAS of white participants. It might also exacerbate existing health disparities across ethnicity and hamper the potential for scientific knowledge and innovation to improve everyone's lives \citep{Martin2019}. Thankfully, multi-ancestry GWAS are becoming more common, but not yet for smoking behavior \citep{Peterson2019}.}
Also, we exclude respondents who reported the onset of a cardiovascular illness since the last survey wave when interviewed at ages 65 or 66. Since HRS surveys are only conducted every 2 years, it is not possible to determine Medicare eligibility status at the time of the health shock for these individuals.\footnote{The results do not change if these individuals are included.}



\subsection{Variables of interest}\label{sec:vars}

\paragraph{Genetic propensity.}
As a measure of an individual's genetic propensity to smoke, we leverage recent developments in molecular and behavioral genetics to construct an index known as a polygenic score (PGS).
A polygenic score is a weighted average of the number of risky genetic variants $G_{ij}$ associated with the probability of smoking that are carried by a particular individual.
For our measure of genetic variants $G_{ij}$, we follow the literature and use the most common form of genetic variation: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), a one base-pair substitution at a particular location (locus) on the human genome.

Specifically, the scores are calculated as follows:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:PGS}
PGS_i = \sum_{j=1}^{J} W_j G_{ij},
\end{align}
\normalsize where $G_{ij}$ is the genotype for individual $i$ at each of the more than 10 million SNP $j$; the weight $W_j$ is the effect size for SNP $j$ estimated via meta-analysis in a different sample than the HRS by the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use (GSCAN) \citep{GSCAN2019gwas}.
The scores have been normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.%
\footnote{As a robustness check, shown in Appendix Section \ref{appsec:TAG2010}, we also use the polygenic score provided by the HRS \citep{HRSPGenscore2017} for the smoking phenotype ``regular smoking'' (having smoked more than 100 cigarettes throughout one's life).
This score is constructed as a weighted sum of the genotype over the 779,538 SNPs that overlap between the HRS genetic database and a 2010 GWAS meta-analysis conducted by the Tobacco and Genetics Consortium \citep{TAG2010}.
See Section \ref{supsec:PGS} in the Appendix for more information on the construction of the PGS.}

To avoid functional form assumptions and maximize power in the statistical analysis, the sample is divided into high- and low-genetic propensity to smoking based on the PGS.
A high-PGS indicator is defined to take the value 1 for individuals in the top 2/3 of the PGS distribution.%
\footnote{We initially ran the analysis separately for each tertile of the PGS distribution, as shown in Appendix Section \ref{appsec:3pgs}, but the results are concentrated in the lower part of the distribution of the PGS, and therefore for simplicity we consider only high and low PGS. Results are robust to splitting the same above and below the median PGS score, as shown in Appendix Section \ref{appsec:median}.}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:PGS}, the distribution of the PGS is bell-shaped, it is shifted to the right for baseline smokers, and it is predictive of current smoking behavior: $\approx$ 30\% of individuals with a PGS higher than 2.5 are current smokers, while only $\approx$ 10\% of individuals with a PGS lower than -2.5 currently smoke.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Health shocks.} Following previous studies \citep{Falba2005,Keenan2009,Khwaja2006spouse,Khwaja2006learn,Smith2001}, we focus on the first occurrence of an acute cardiovascular condition.
Cardiovascular conditions include either a heart problem (heart attack, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, or other heart problems) or a stroke (or transient ischemic attack).
These conditions have strong links to tobacco use, have a relatively high incidence among older adults, and are likely to require immediate and intensive use of costly medical services \citep{Thorpe2004,Teo2006,Lloyd-Jones2010}.
Additionally, they can occur repeatedly for the same individual and thereby incentivize improvements in health behaviors to prevent a recurrence.

The health shock is a binary indicator set to 1 if the respondent is diagnosed with a new cardiovascular condition during the time since the last HRS survey, but does not have a history of cardiovascular disease prior to this diagnosis.
The exact timing of the health shock within the past 2 years since the last interview is not observed, and the diagnoses are all self-reported.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:cv}, the rate of cardiovascular health problems increase with age from about 2\% to 4\% annually, but it is not strongly related to the PGS and, most importantly, does not jump around the age of 65 (see also Figure \ref{fig:cv_prob} in the Appendix).

	}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Health Insurance.}
Before the age of 65, HRS respondents are classified as uninsured in a given survey wave if they report not being covered by \textit{any} health insurance plan.
Respondents are classified as being \textit{persistently uninsured} if they were uninsured in every wave between 60 and 65.
%A binary variable is defined for pre-65 uninsured status that takes the value 1 if a respondent is uninsured in every observation before the age of 65.

The share of persistently uninsured individuals is shown in panel A of Figure \ref{fig:Medicare_unins}.

After the age of 65, individuals are considered eligible for Medicare.
As shown in Panel B of Figure \ref{fig:Medicare_unins}, the vast majority of individuals are aware of Medicare eligibility: more than 90\% of individuals report being covered by Medicare after the age of 65.

	}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Smoking status.} The outcome of interest is a self-reported binary indicator for current smoking status.
It is set to 1 if the respondent is an ever-smoker (having smoked more than 100 cigarettes throughout one's life) and smoking at the time of the survey.
%We also calculate cessation rates, defined as smoking in the previous but not in the current wave.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:smoking}, the prevalence of smokers in the sample decreases with age and is about 5 percentage points higher for the individuals with a high PGS.

\subsection{Sample Characteristics}\label{sec:sumstats}

Characteristics of the study sample used in the analysis are summarized in the first column of Table \ref{tab:descriptives_full}.
The study sample consists of 5,854 individuals (and 26,022 person-year observations).
The average age at baseline is 61.2 years, 49.9\% of the sample is made up of women, and 29.5\% smoke at baseline.
Individuals are observed for 4.5 waves on average, a good panel dimension even if restricted to the 60-70 age range.
%has 12.4 years of education, and reports an income of \$20,101 per year.
5.9\% of individuals in the sample are uninsured in all observations before the age of 65, and 12.3\% experience a cardiovascular health shock during the observation period.
The second and third columns in Table \ref{tab:descriptives_full} describe the sample stratified into 2 genetic groups.
High-PGS respondents are 4 percentage points more likely to smoke at baseline, 0.7 percentage points more likely to be uninsured before the age of 65, and included relatively more women compared to the low-PGS respondents.%
\footnote{This slight gender imbalance is a feature of our sampling strategy and not of the PGS, which is balanced across genders in the original paper \citep{GSCAN2019gwas}. None of the results are driven by gender differences, which are always controlled for in the analysis.
Appendix Section \ref{supsec:descriptive} provides additional descriptive information about the study sample that experienced a health shock.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ANALYSIS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Empirical Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

\noindent
%We report two sets of results: first of all, we compare the average smoking cessation rates for those who suffer a health shock before and after the age of 65, stratified by high and low genetic propensity.
%We then run a more sophisticated analysis controlling for age and individual characteristics.
In a within-person analysis with individual fixed effects, we compare the change in smoking rates after suffering a health shock across four types of persistently uninsured people: younger or older than 65 (as a proxy of exposure to health insurance via Medicare) and high or low genetic propensity to smoking.
We focus on persistently uninsured people, i.e. people who reported being uninsured in every observation of the study sample before age 65, to zoom in on the potential for moral hazard.

The identification strategy builds on previous work \citep{Marti2017} and leverages the differential timing of health shocks before or after Medicare eligibility at age 65.
Conditional on having suffered a health shock, the exact \textit{timing} of the shock is arguably both exogenous and unanticipated.
While the probability of experiencing a health shock increases with age \citep{Lloyd-Jones2010}, no observable jump or change in trend can be seen in our data in the percentage of respondents reporting a health shock around the age of 65 (see Figures \ref{fig:cv} and \ref{fig:cv_prob} as well as Section \ref{supsec:age_pattern_cv} in the appendix for details).
Notice, however, that only the age at the time of the interview is known, not the age at the time of the cardiovascular health shock, which could have happened any time since the prior interview (about 2 years before).
Therefore, our dataset is not precise enough to estimate a possible discontinuity in the probability of suffering a cardiovascular health shock at age 65.
Nevertheless, the absence of a jump at the time of Medicare eligibility is consistent with the work of \cite{Card2008,Card2009medicare} who, using much more granular data, find a sharp increase in health care utilization at age 65, but no discontinuity in the probability of suffering from a health shock.

The absence of a jump is reassuring for our identification strategy, which relies on a comparison before and after the age of 65: accounting for age, respondents experiencing the shock after 65 should not be systematically different from respondents experiencing the shock before 65.
This setting thus provides a good framework for estimating the causal effect of health care eligibility on the smoking response to a health shock in individuals who are uninsured before the age of 65.

Conceptually, this design aims to mimic the following hypothetical comparison: within both the low-PGS and the high-PGS group, compare the change in smoking status after suffering a health shock for two respondents with similar characteristics (ever smokers, persistently uninsured, similar genetic propensity to smoke, gender, etc).
The only difference between the two individuals is the point in time at which they experience the shock and, hence, their exposure to the financial costs associated with it.
Who responds more to the financial exposure: the high-PGS or the low-PGS type?

Methodologically, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to estimate a linear probability model for smoking.
Current smoking status ($Y$) is regressed on the full set of interactions between the indicators for the health shock ($shock$), being uninsured pre-65 ($uninsured$), Medicare eligibility ($post65$), and high polygenic score for smoking ($g$):

\begin{align} \label{eq:regression}
Y_{it}& \thinspace  = \thinspace
				\beta \thinspace shock_{it} + \gamma \thinspace post65_{it} \\
				&+\lambda_1 \thinspace  (shock_{it} \times post65_{it}) \nonumber \\
				&+ \lambda_2 \thinspace (shock_{it} \times uninsured_i) \nonumber \\
				&+\lambda_3  \thinspace (post65_{it} \times uninsured_i) \nonumber \\
				&+ \lambda_4 \thinspace (shock_{it} \times g_i) \nonumber \\
				&+\lambda_5 \thinspace (post65_{it} \times g_i) \nonumber \\
				&+ \delta_1 \thinspace (shock_{it} \times post65_{it} \times uninsured_i) \nonumber \\
				&+ \delta_2 \thinspace (shock_{it} \times uninsured_i \times g_i) \nonumber \\
				&+ \delta_3 \thinspace (shock_{it} \times post65_{it} \times g_i) \nonumber \\
				&+ \delta_4 \thinspace (post65_{it} \times uninsured_i \times g_i) \nonumber\\
				&+ \zeta \thinspace (shock_{it} \times post65_{it} \times uninsured_i \times g_i) \nonumber \\
				&+ \sum_{a=1}^3 \phi_a \thinspace age_{it}^{a} + \eta_i + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{it} \nonumber
\end{align}

Individual fixed effects ($\eta_i$) are included to control for unobserved time-invariant differences between respondents, and time fixed effects ($\tau_t$) to control for time-specific confounders.
In addition, a third-degree polynomial of the respondent's age in years at the time of the interview ($age$) is added to non-linearly control for the reduction in smoking rates shown in Figure \ref{fig:smoking}.
Standard errors are clustered at the individual level.
%All statistical analyses in this study are conducted with the software R, version 3.4.2, and various open-source packages \citep{broom,car,ggplot2,haven,labelled,lmtest,multcomp,plm,plyr,readr,readxl,reshape2,sandwich,scales,stargazer,stringr,tidyverse}.

The statistical method resembles a difference-in-differences approach: focusing on the group of previously uninsured individuals, we compared the effect of a health shock for those experiencing it before or after Medicare eligibility, and who have either a low or high genetic propensity to smoke.
%The subgroup of interest is comprised of those who are uninsured before the age of 65, and for whom Medicare eligibility hence represented a drastic reduction in the financial risk associated with poor health.
%For this subgroup, which comprises 327 individuals, the comparisons of interest are experiencing the health shock before versus after age 65, and having a low versus a high genetic propensity to smoke.
%

We are interested in 3 different types of effects for the group of previously uninsured individuals:

First, what is the marginal effect of a health shock on smoking?
This effect is calculated for 4 different subgroups, given by the combinations of shock timing (pre- or post-65) and genetic risk (high or low), and shown in Figure \ref{fig:shock_effects}.
For each subgroup, the effect is comprised of the sum of all coefficient estimates from Equation (\ref{eq:regression}) that applied for the given group.
For example, for previously uninsured individuals who experienced the shock before the age of 65 and who had a low genetic susceptibility for smoking, the effect of the health shock is calculated by summing up the estimates for $\beta$ and $\lambda_2$.
If the health shock is instead experienced after 65, the effect of the shock (for the same group of previously uninsured low-PGS individuals) is the sum of the estimates for $\beta$, $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, and $\delta_1$.

Second, what is the causal effect of Medicare eligibility (and hence a change in the financial costs associated with a health shock) on smoking?
This effect is calculated using the difference between the pre-65 shock effect and the post-65 shock effect for each of the 2 genetic groups.
For the low-PGS group, it is given by the sum of the estimates for $\lambda_1$ and $\delta_1$.
For the high-PGS group, it is given by the sum of  $\lambda_1$, $\delta_1$, $\delta_3$, and $\zeta$.

Lastly, does the effect of health insurance vary according to individual genetic predisposition?
Comparing the effect of Medicare eligibility on the post-shock smoking decision between the high- and the low-PGS groups we can assess the presence of genetic heterogeneity in moral hazard.
The presence of genetic heterogeneity in moral hazard is estimated by the sum of $\delta_3$ and $\zeta$ in Equation (\ref{eq:regression}).%

The effect of a health shock on the smoking probability of individuals who are uninsured before the age of 65---the subgroup of interest---for the 4 combinations of shock timing (before or after 65) and polygenic score (high or low) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:shock_effects} and Panel A of Table \ref{tab:main_effects}.
Since we are controlling for individual fixed effects, these coefficients can be interpreted as the change in the probability of smoking after suffering a health shock.
All of the regression coefficients are presented in the last column of Table \ref{tab:reg_results_multi}.

Following a health shock, persistently uninsured individuals with a high polygenic score tend to reduce their smoking behavior by about 10 percentage points, irrespective of whether the health shock happens before or after the age of 65.
Since the response to the health shock is the same before and after the age of Medicare eligibility, there is no evidence of moral hazard in this subgroup.
With a 30.8\% baseline probability of smoking, this 10 percentage point reduction is non-negligible, but it is very nosily estimated and is indistinguishable from zero.

On the contrary, the response of low polygenic score individuals differs markedly by the \textit{timing} of the health shock: if the shock happens before the age of 65, while not covered by Medicare or another health insurance, they reduce smoking by 17 percentage points.
With a baseline probability of smoking of 27\%, this reduction is very sizable.
On the other hand, if the health shock happens after the age of Medicare eligibility, low polygenic score individuals increase their smoking rate by 9 percentage points as compared to the rest of the population.
Against the backdrop of a steady decline in smoking rates, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:smoking}, this positive coefficient can be interpreted as a lower decrease in smoking for this particular sub-population.%
\footnote{Notice that the magnitude of this coefficient (0.09) is similar to the ones estimated for high polygenic score individuals (-0.108 and -0.13), but it is much more precisely estimated. The main reason behind smaller standard errors for the estimated effect of health shock after 65 for the low polygenic score individuals is the negative covariance $Cov(\hat{\delta}_1,\hat{\lambda}_2) =  -0.0057$. See Appendix Table \ref{suptab:cov_matrix} for the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients of equation \ref{eq:regression}. $\lambda_2$ captures the effect of the health shock in the uninsured population, and $\delta_1$ the incremental effect of that same health shock in the uninsured population after the age of 65.}

The difference in the smoking response depending on the timing of the health shock, before or after the age of 65, is summarized in Panel B of Table \ref{tab:main_effects}: individuals with a low polygenic score are 25.6 percentage points more likely to stop smoking if the health shock happens before the age of 65, when they are not covered by health insurance.
High polygenic score individuals, on the other hand, are 2.3 percentage points more likely to do the opposite, a small and (statistically) insignificant difference.

Such marked difference in the response across the two genetic types is evidence of genetic heterogeneity in the effect of Medicare eligibility on the response to the shock.
This genetic heterogeneity, a form of `gene-environment interaction' (or G$\times$E) according to behavioral geneticists,\footnote{See for instance \cite{Haldane1946,Anastasi1958,Plomin1977,Ottman1990,Plomin1990}.} is summarized in Panel C of Table \ref{tab:main_effects}: low PGS individuals are 27.9 percentage points less likely than high PGS individuals to stop smoking if the health shock happens when they are uninsured.

The evidence in favor of genetic heterogeneity is remarkably stable to the inclusion of different controls and fixed effects, as shown in the different columns of Table \ref{tab:reg_results_multi}.
The first column does not include polynomial controls for age or any type of time or individual fixed effects; still, the sum of the estimated $\delta_3$ $(shock_{it} \times post65_{it} \times g_i)$ and $\zeta$ $(shock_{it} \times post65_{it} \times uninsured_i \times g_i)$ coefficients is 32.6 percentage points, close to the 27.9 estimated with age controls and time and individual fixed effects, as reported in Panel  C of Table \ref{tab:main_effects}.

\end{table}

How can we interpret this evidence of genetic heterogeneity?
This result is consistent with the interpretation that high polygenic score individuals are less responsive and elastic in their response to shocks and changes in the environment.
Regardless of whether the health shock happens when they are covered by health insurance, and therefore whether they are financially liable for the consequences of the health shock, they reduce smoking the same amount.
Individuals with a low polygenic score are instead more flexible, strategic, and reactive to the environment: they reduce their smoking only when they bear the full cost of the consequences of negative health shocks.
This result is therefore consistent with genetic heterogeneity in moral hazard.

\subsection{Other Interpretations}\label{sec:interpret}

\paragraph{Is it really Medicare?}
Other factors besides eligibility to Medicare may be at play around the age of 65, the most prominent being retirement.
Such factors might affect smoking behavior after health shocks and change the interpretation of our coefficient.
Our empirical result about genetic heterogeneity would still stand, but the post-65 dummy could not be considered purely as a measure of health care eligibility, and the differential reduction in smoking before 65 would not be evidence of moral hazard heterogeneity.

However, these alternative interpretations are at odds with two findings: there is no effect for those already insured before the age of 65, and there is no differential effect on income or retirement.

First, as Table \ref{tab:reg_results_multi} shows, the estimated coefficient on the \textsf{shock x post-65} interaction is close to 0 and not statistically significant, suggesting no differential effect of the health shock on the probability of smoking for those individuals already covered by health insurance before the age of 65.
If other factors rather than health insurance status were to cause the difference between the effects of a pre- vs. post-65 health shock in the low-PGS group, one could expect to also see an effect for those already insured before the age of 65.

Secondly, as Panels (a), (b), and (c) of Figure \ref{fig:income_ret} show, there is no apparent jump in income or the probability of retirement exactly at the age of 65 in our sample.
Contrasting this with the sharp change in enrollment in Medicare (Figure \ref{fig:Medicare_unins}) and drop in the share of uninsured (Figure \ref{fig:Medicare_unins}) suggests that the main event captured by the post-65 dummy for the sample of previously uninsured individuals is access to health coverage.

Finally, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:confounders}, there is no differential effect of the health shock before or after the age of 65 on the reported income or the probability of retirement of persistently uninsured individuals.
The absence of any discernible effect suggests that neither income nor retirement are potential mechanisms behind the observed change in smoking responses.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Is it really genes?}
Other individual-level characteristics, besides genetic predispositions, might be driving this heterogeneity in moral hazard.
For instance, education, cognitive abilities, personality traits, or risk aversion might be a better proxy of individual level heterogeneity driving a differential response to health shocks.
Given the richness of the HRS data, we can run the same analysis outlined in equation \ref{eq:regression} but replacing $g_i$ with other individual characteristics.

None of the other individual measures that we have tried seems to be driving heterogeneity in moral hazard, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:otherX}.
Specifically, we tested for years of education (highly educated people might be more knowledgeable of the insurance system), a proxy of cognitive abilities\footnote{Calculated by HRS as the sum of a word recall task (Total Recall Index) and a counting, naming, and vocabulary task (Mental Status Index).
%The total recall index (RwTR20, R1TR40, RwATR20, RwHTR40) is available in all waves and summarizes the immediate and delayed word recall tasks. In Waves 1 and 2H, the recall wordlist contained 20 words, while in all other waves it contained 10. Thus the scores range from 0 to 40 in Waves 1 and 2H and from 0 to 20 in other waves. \\
%The mental status index (RwMSTOT, R2AMSTOT) sums scores from counting, naming, and vocabulary tasks and is available for Wave 2A and from Wave 3 forward. This reflects the absence of some of these tests in Waves 1 and 2H. \\
%A total cognition score (RwCOGTOT, R2ACGTOT) sums the total recall and mental status indices. Because the mental status index is missing for Waves 1 and 2H, the total cognition index is also missing for these waves.
%Total Cognition score goes from 0 to 35. \\
%Further detail on this variables can be found ion RAND HRS Longitudinal File Codebook.
} (smart people might be more strategic), risk aversion measured through hypothetical gambles on lifetime income (individual risk preferences might moderate both smoking behaviors and the response to health shocks), the Big-5 personality trait conscientiousness (conscientious people might be more likely to follow the doctor's advice of stopping smoking after a health shock), gender (social scientist's favorite sample split to engage in ex-post rationalizations), and individual and household income (which might be a buffer for the negative shock).%
\footnote{Notice that some of these variables are not quite predetermined, baseline characteristics of the individuals. Some might actually be mediators of the overall effect, or ``bad controls'' in the terminology of \cite{Angrist2008}, especially income. We still report the results for completeness, but caution the reader prone to causal interpretations.
In this regard, genetic variants represent the ideal measure of heterogeneity of treatment effects: they are fixed since conception, immutable, identically measured across the whole human species, and indexing plausible biological channels which are increasingly studied and documented by a wide range of disciplines.
In Appendix \ref{appsec:otherPGS}, we report the results of using different polygenic scores as a proxy for $g_i$.
Moral hazard heterogeneity is also detected in the group having a high PGS for educational attainment or cognitive abilities \citep{Lee2018}, and a low PGS for risk tolerance \citep{KarlssonLinner2019} and a low PGS for non-cognitive skills \citep{Demange2020}.
On the other side, there is no evidence of heterogeneity of moral hazard by the PGS for Body-Mass-Index \citep{Yengo2018} or the PGS for cigarettes per day \citep{GSCAN2019gwas}.
These results suggest that potential mechanisms for the observed heterogeneity should include not only biological channels related to nicotine addiction, but also cognitive processes related to risky and strategic behavior, which are closely related to the concept of moral hazard.

For completeness, results are shown split by tertiles for continuous measures, and in two for binary measures.

\paragraph{Is this driven by confounders?}
One might worry that the differential change in smoking behavior might be driven by other confounding factors that coincidentally happen around the age of 65, or are triggered by the health shock.
For example, suffering a heart attack might reduce people's income, induce them to retire, change their marital status, increase their out-of-pocket medical spending, or shorten their life expectancy.
Any of these changes happening differentially for people with high or a low polygenic score, and before or after the age of 65, could invalidate our results or at least our interpretation of the effect as evidence of moral hazard.
To test the plausibility of these concerns, we estimate equation \ref{eq:regression} again including each of these potential confounders as an outcome variable $Y_{it}$, as suggested by \cite{Pei2018}.

None of these potential confounders seems to be driving our results, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:confounders}.
If anything, the symmetric results for out-of-pocket medical expenditure shown in panel (e) suggest that the size of the health shock is comparable for both high and low PGS individuals: both report an increase of about 2\% in out-of-pocket medical expenditure if the shock happens before the age of 65 (when uninsured) and a change smaller than 0.3\% if the shock happened after for low PGS, and a reduction of about 1\% for those with high PGS (and not statistically significant for neither of these last two estimators).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Discussion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Robustness checks} \label{sec:robustness}
These results are robust to changes in the definition of the high-PGS indicator (having a PGS above the median, using a linear PGS, using an older GWAS for the weights) and the definition of the pre-65 uninsured status indicator (uninsured in 33\% or 66\% of all pre-65 observations instead of 100\%). %, and the age range used for the study sample (59-71, 58-72, 57-73, 56-74, or 55-75 instead of 60-70).
Relaxing the definition of the uninsured indicator to include respondents uninsured in a minimum of 33\% of pre-65 observations leaves the directions of the effects unchanged, but the magnitudes are smaller and statistical significance is lost.
Furthermore, the findings of this study do not depend on the exclusion of HRS respondents for whom Medicare eligibility status at the time of the shock is unknown (when health shocks are reported at ages 65 or 66).
Estimation results for all robustness checks are shown in Section \ref{supsec:robustness} in the Appendix.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Discussion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

In this study, experiencing a cardiovascular health shock is associated with a significant reduction in the smoking probability of uninsured 60- to 64-year-old individuals with a low index of genetic propensity to smoke.
Medicare eligibility after age 65 (and hence a lower exposure to the financial costs of illness) fully neutralized this cessation effect, indicating the presence of moral hazard caused by insurance coverage.
For individuals with a high genetic propensity to smoke, experiencing a health shock does not significantly affect the smoking probability, irrespective of whether the shock is at a time of high or low exposure to the financial costs of illness.


The effect of health shocks on changes in smoking behavior, as well as the underlying mechanisms, have been addressed before \citep{Wray1998,Smith2001,Clark2002,Falba2005,Khwaja2006spouse,Khwaja2006learn,Keenan2009,Sundmacher2012,Richards2014,Marti2017}.
Previous empirical work has found strong evidence of an increase in smoking cessation after a health shock \citep{Wray1998,Clark2002,Falba2005,Keenan2009,Sundmacher2012,Richards2014,Marti2017}.
The mechanism that has received a lot of attention in earlier research is a changed perception of personal health risks and survival probability, motivating the individual to reduce tobacco consumption to improve future health \citep{Smith2001,Clark2002,Khwaja2006spouse,Khwaja2006learn}.

\cite{Richards2014,Marti2017} have highlighted the role that financial costs associated with health shocks, as opposed to only the health considerations, can play in determining the post-shock smoking decision.
In individuals with high financial risk exposure, health shocks may bring about significant out-of-pocket medical costs.
At the same time, the financial consequences of smoking-related illness are likely more complex and opaque to the individual than the health-related consequences of smoking.

The mechanism presented in these studies suggests that through improving their grasp on the financial cost of smoking, the increase in out-of-pocket health care costs following the health shock can serve as an impetus for smoking cessation.
Using the same design that we follow in this analysis (the age-based eligibility threshold for the Medicare program), a recent study has provided robust evidence for this mechanism \citep{Marti2017}.
Without investigating potential heterogeneity between genetic groups, they found that, on average, moral hazard is present, and Medicare eligibility reduced the cessation effect that a cardiovascular health shock had for uninsured individuals.

Our analysis shows that this average effect is likely driven by individuals with a low genetic predisposition for smoking only.
The effect cannot be observed for the subgroup of individuals with a high genetic predisposition for smoking, suggesting that genetic makeup can act as a constraint and limit the extent to which incentives for behavior change are translated into actual behavior change.

The question of how insurance policies can interact with genetic predispositions for risky health behaviors is interesting from a policy perspective for several reasons. The finding that insurance affected the post-shock smoking decision only in part of the sample suggests that the considered type of moral hazard in health insurance, which causes excess smoking among an already sick population, is less prevalent than an initial inspection may suggest.
This insight may alleviate one possible concern against universal public health care coverage \citep{Mendoza2016,Einav2018}.

On a broader level, awareness of the possibility of interactions between genetics and health insurance is important for understanding how the health insurance system can increase or reduce genetically induced health inequalities in a society.
By highlighting the role of genetic influences on the propensity for and ability to quit unhealthy behaviors, this study also points to possible limitations on the extent to which insurance can cause health behavior changes through financial incentives.

Genetically determined limitations on the effectiveness of financial incentives are important to consider not just when evaluating the effectiveness of health insurance policies, but also the fairness therein.
With recent technological advances, for example in the field of wearable tech, health insurers are discovering more and more possibilities for monitoring health behaviors.
This information is increasingly used for pricing, with the explicit goal of motivating behavior change through financial incentives in the form of lower insurance premiums or deductibles \citep{Forbes2014,SwissRe2017}.


In light of this development, the possibility that genetic predisposition prevents individuals from changing health behaviors, despite strong incentives for doing so, is becoming increasingly relevant.
By emphasizing the correlation between genetic risk and an inability to quit unhealthy behaviors, the findings in this study may raise the following question: To what extent do insurance policies that price differentiate based on health behaviors ultimately also discriminate based on genetics? Under current US legislation, the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prohibits health insurers from discriminating based on explicit genetic information.
Not wanting to punish those who are disadvantaged in terms of their genetic makeup is one of the motivations behind this legislation.
To create a health insurance system that can incentivize healthy behaviors and simultaneously reflect society's perception of fairness, it will be important for future research to further enhance our understanding of how genetics and health insurance interact and jointly affect health behaviors.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{sec:limitations}

This study has a few limitations.
First, the results hinge on a small number of respondents who suffer a health shock around the age of 65. Although the total sample size used in the regression is greater than 5 thousand individuals, the number of people in each cell (i.e. those who suffer a health shock, before or after the age of 65, and have a certain polygenic score) is between 110 and 274.\footnote{See number of observations in Appendix Table \ref{suptab:descriptive_subgroup}.}
We encourage and welcome a replication of our results, preferably in a within-family design which can better account for the thorny issue of ancestry and population structure, but we are unaware of an existing dataset that contains all of the necessary information about genetic predispositions, health insurance coverage, and smoking behaviors.

Second, the analysis focused on the short-run smoking response to a health shock, and only considered changes in the extensive margin---i.e., changes between smoking and not smoking.
From a public health perspective, interactions of genetics with both the long-term persistence of the behavior change as well as behavior changes along the intensive margin of smoking---i.e., changes in the number of cigarettes smoked or the intention to quit smoking---may be of interest.

Third, a few caveats regarding the internal validity of the study.
This study relied on self-reported information regarding smoking behavior, health diagnoses, and insurance status.
If participants of different ages and different genotypes differentially misreported their smoking status, for example, the estimated effect of Medicare eligibility on the smoking response to a health shock could be biased.
We have found no published evidence that misreporting might be associated with individual genotypes.
It is also possible that those identified as continuously uninsured before the age of 65 had insured spells in between the biennial HRS interviews.
These unmeasured episodes with coverage may have biased the results towards not finding a significant effect of Medicare eligibility.
Finally, this study may also suffer from survivorship bias and attrition.
Because DNA collection and genotyping took place relatively late during the HRS (starting in 2006), it is possible that study participants with very high genetic susceptibility for smoking, and hence particularly unhealthy smoking habits, passed away before the DNA collection and are systematically excluded from the study population.
Within the study population, participants with the highest genetic propensity to smoke may have been less likely to reach the age of Medicare eligibility, hence leading to relatively lower genetic risk in the group that experienced health shocks post-65.
Both problems would likely have lead to an underestimation of the difference between low- and high-PGS individuals.

Lastly, a few words of caution on the external validity of the study.
The transition from being uninsured to being eligible for Medicare at age 65 is a setting that is very specific to the health care system in the US.
While Medicare can generally be seen as just one example of universal health care coverage, it only applies to a specific age group, and it is not clear whether smoking behaviors in response to a health shock in this age group are representative for all ages in the population.
Another possible concern may be that Medicare eligibility does not necessarily translate into Medicare coverage, as take-up rates are not at 100\%.
As Figure \ref{fig:Medicare_unins} shows, however, the fraction of eligible HRS respondents in the study sample who are actually enrolled in Medicare is high---approximately 90\% at age 65, increasing to 98\% at age 70.
Additionally, take-up patterns do not differ much between the genetic groups.
Table \ref{suptab:main_effects_medicare} in the Appendix shows that using actual Medicare enrollment status rather than Medicare eligibility status in the empirical analysis does not change the results.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Conclusion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

Medicare eligibility significantly lowered the probability of smoking cessation after a health shock in individuals aged between 60 and 70 years who are uninsured before the age of 65 and have a low genetic predisposition for smoking.
Health insurance can plausibly affect the smoking response to a health shock by lowering the financial risk associated with the shock, and thereby eroding additional incentives for behavior change.
This change in behavior following Medicare eligibility is indicative of moral hazard and is not observable among individuals with a high genetic predisposition for smoking.
The differential effect of Medicare eligibility for the two genetic groups suggests that biological constraints can overpower both health-related and financial incentives for smoking cessation, and provides a readily available measure of heterogeneity in moral hazard.
Heterogeneity in moral hazard can be used to enrich economic models of health behavior\footnote{For example, see the model in Appendix \ref{appsec:model}.} and our understanding of how individual biological characteristics can influence decision-making.

Building on previous work analyzing the interplay between genes and exogenous environmental changes \citep{Fletcher2012,Schmitz2017,Barcellos2018}, this study provides a contribution to the centennial debate about nature \textit{and} nurture \citep{Mulcaster1582,Galton1874,Haldane1946,Lundborg2010,Kong2018}, casting further doubts about genetic determinism.
The influence of genetic variants on our choices and outcomes is modulated by the environment around us, just as the response to environmental shocks is filtered through the prism of our genetic predispositions.

Our results show that genetic factors can influence health decisions and strategic behaviors, and therefore should be taken into consideration when evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of different policies, such as health insurance.
Fairness considerations should take into account the fact that genetic endowments are passed down from one generation to the next, are fixed at conception, and cannot be changed by an individual's choices or effort, raising questions of deservedness, merit, and luck \citep{Pereira2021,Harden2021,Kweon2020}.
Efficiency considerations should consider that genetic endowments are usually unobserved to the individual, the insurance companies, and the government.
This unobservability raises important regulatory questions at the intersection between health and information economics: who, if anyone, should have this information? How should the information be provided? How will this information affect demand and supply? Should private contracts or public policies take this information into account?
The recent rise of direct-to-consumer genetic testing services might force this discussion into the public debate sooner than expected.

More generally, future studies should build off of the idea of leveraging existing indices of genetic predispositions to provide biological measures of heterogeneity in human behaviors.
This can enrich economic models and empirical studies, shedding new light on fundamental economic parameters.
